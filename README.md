[![built with nix](https://builtwithnix.org/badge.svg)](https://builtwithnix.org)

For setting up development environment on any Unix machine (Darwin/Linux). The
config officially supports macOS & NixOS & managed by [nix][nix]

## What's in it?

These are the main configs:

- [nix][nix] to manage installing most of the dependencies, for GUI apps on
  macsOS I'm still using
  [Homebrew cask](https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask) through the
  homebrew module in
  [`nix-darwin`](https://github.com/LnL7/nix-darwin/blob/5c3146b75d5d478f0693d0ea6c83f1da8382ff56/modules/homebrew.nix)
- [neomutt][neomutt] for reading emails
- [tmux][tmux] 2.3 or later
- [Neovim][neovim]
- [Zsh][zsh]
- [Git][git]
- [Kitty][kitty] as my terminal
- [weechat][weechat] IRC client
- [hammerspoon][hammerspoon] macOS automation, using it for window management &
  other stuff

## Officially supported OSs

- ARM macOS Sonoma
- [Experimental] NixOS (tested on 22.11)

## Installation

1. Install `nix` (I tested mostly with
   <https://github.com/DeterminateSystems/nix-installer>, but I think everything
   should work fine with the default nix installer)

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf -L https://install.determinate.systems/nix | sh -s -- install
```

2. Set up

> [!NOTE]
>
> The flake attribute in my case is usually is the host machine name, if not
> passed it will default to `$(hostname -s)`

online:

```bash
nix run "github:ahmedelgabri/dotfiles" -- <flake attribute>
```

### Homebrew

I still use it mostly for GUI apps, since Nix and/or Home-manager support for
GUI applications have problems with symlinking to the `Applications/` folder.
Homebrew is fully managed by `nix` it gets installed and run through nix using
[`nix-homebrew`](https://github.com/zhaofengli/nix-homebrew)

### Notes

- zsh: add these to `${XDG_DATA_HOME}/$(hostname)/zshrc`

```zsh
export HOMEBREW_GITHUB_API_TOKEN =
export GITHUB_TOKEN =
export WEECHAT_PASSPHRASE =
```

- For git add your GPG key info in `${XDG_DATA_HOME}/$(hostname)/gitconfig`

```
[user]
  signingkey =
```

Don't forget to upload your public key to
[GitHub](https://github.com/blog/2144-gpg-signature-verification)!

> Note: There needs to be a three-way match on your email for GitHub to show the
> commit as 'verified': The commit email, github email, & the email associated
> with the public key

#### Email

My email messages are synchronised between the remote server and my computer
with [isync][isync], I read them with [neomutt][neomutt] and search index is
built by [notmuch][notmuch].

After linking the dotfiles, there are only a few more things that need to be
done.

##### Authentication

Each account must authenticate with an IMAP server and an SMTP server. The
passwords, need be stored in the [OS X keychain][keychain].

For Fastmail (or Gmail accounts with two-factor authentication enabled), use an
application-specific password.

In order for all this to work, a few items have to be stored in the macOS
keychain:

Create a "generic"(A.K.A. "application") keychain item (that is, without
protocols, only hostnames):

For sending mail:

- An item with:
  - "Keychain Item Name": fastmail.com
  - "Account Name": username+mutt@fastmail.com

**Repeat this for each account you want to add.**

## Synchronizing periodically

Incoming messages are fetched from the remote server when `mbsync` runs (the
executable name for isync).

On macs I use [`launchd`][launchd], on NixOS using `systemd`. You can check
[`mail.nix`](nix/modules/shared/mail.nix).
