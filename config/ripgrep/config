# Automatically switch to PCRE2 when needed; eg. for:
#
# | Lookaround          | Example     | Description                 |
# | ------------------- | ----------- | --------------------------- |
# | Negative lookbehind | (?<!foo)bar | "bar" not preceded by "foo" |
# | Negative lookahead  | foo(?!bar)  | "foo" not followed by "bar" |
# | Positive lookbehind | (?<=foo)bar | "bar" preceded by "foo"     |
# | Positive lookahead  | foo(?=bar)  | "foo" followed by "bar"     |
#
# --engine=ENGINE
#     Specify which regular expression engine to use. When you choose a
#     regex engine, it applies that choice for every regex provided to
#     ripgrep (e.g., via multiple -e/--regexp or -f/--file flags).
#
#     Accepted values are default, pcre2, or auto.
#
#     The default value is default, which is usually the fastest and
#     should be good for most use cases. The pcre2 engine is generally
#     useful when you want to use features such as look-around or
#     backreferences. auto will dynamically choose between supported
#     regex engines depending on the features used in a pattern on a
#     best effort basis.
#
#     Note that the pcre2 engine is an optional ripgrep feature. If
#     PCRE2 wasn't included in your build of ripgrep, then using this
#     flag will result in ripgrep printing an error message and exiting.
#
#     This overrides previous uses of the -P/--pcre2 and --auto-hybrid-regex
#     flags.
