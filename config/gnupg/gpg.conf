# Some suggestions added from riseup https://we.riseup.net/riseuplabs+paow/openpgp-best-practices
## When creating a key, individuals may designate a specific keyserver to use to pull their keys from.
## The above option will disregard this designation and use the pool, which is useful because (1) it
## prevents someone from designating an insecure method for pulling their key and (2) if the server
## designated uses hkps, the refresh will fail because the ca-cert will not match, so the keys will
## never be refreshed.
keyserver-options no-honor-keyserver-url

## include an unambiguous indicator of which key made a signature:
